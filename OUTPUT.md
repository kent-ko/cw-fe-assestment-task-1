## Changes Made

### [App.tsx]

1. useEffect dependency issues in BoxArea108 (lines 47-54)
   - Issue: Issue: useEffect calling onSearch(innerValue) on every render with [innerValue, onSearch] dependencies causing infinite re-renders and stale closures
   - Fix: Removed problematic useEffect pattern, replaced with custom useSearch hook that properly debounces search calls
2. Generic AI-generated component names (lines 15, 25)
   - Issue: BoxArea97 and BoxArea108 are not standard names that hurt code readability and maintainability
   - Fix: Renamed to semantic names HeroSection and SearchInput and then moved them to dedicated component files with proper structure
3. Missing TypeScript prop definitions (lines 9, 25)
   - Issue: TagList function has no prop types, BoxArea108 uses inline types instead of interfaces
   - Fix: Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces (Tag, TagSectionProps, SearchInputProps) in dedicated files
4. Component organization and file structure (entire file)
   - Issue: All components cramped in single 100+ line file, violating separation of concerns
   - Fix: Split into modular structure: components/layout/Header.tsx, components/sections/HeroSection.tsx, components/sections/TagSection.tsx
5. Hard-coded tag data in component state (lines 84-91)
   - Issue: Tag arrays defined in component state with setTags that's never used, mixing data with UI logic
   - Fix: Moved to constants/tags.ts with proper typing, separated trending and personalized tags
6. Missing accessibility and interaction handlers (lines 9-20)
   - Issue: TagList renders non-interactive badges with no keyboard support or click handlers
   - Fix: Added onTagClick callback with proper event handling and accessibility features

### [Header.tsx (extracted from original lines 79-100)] 

1. Static header search input (lines 96 - 100)
   - Issue: Header search has hardcoded value="search" with no onChange handler, making it non-functional
   - Fix: Implemented working search with state management and proper event handling using reusable SearchInput component
2. Nested span structure for search icon(lines 89 - 95)
   - Issue: Unnecessarily complex nested span structure <span><span><span> with absolute positioning
   - Fix: Simplified to clean structure with proper icon positioning using SearchInput component
3. Inline styles instead of Tailwind classes(lines 102)
   - Issue: Avatar using inline style={{ width: "32px", height: "32px" }} instead of Tailwind utilities
   - Fix: Replaced with Tailwind classes w-8 h-8 and added hover states for better UX

### [TagList - TagSection (extracted from original lines 8 - 24)] 

1. Missing semantic HTML structure
   - Issue: Using generic div elements without proper semantic markup for screen readers
   - Fix: Added <section> element with aria-labelledby linking to heading, and role="list" for tag container
2. No interactive functionality (line 20 -24)
   - Issue: Tags render as static badges with no click handlers or keyboard navigation
   - Fix: Added onTagClick prop, keyboard support (Enter/Space), and proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
3. Missing TypeScript prop validation
   - Issue: Function parameters { title, tags } have no type definitions
   - Fix: Created TagSectionProps interface with proper typing for title: string and tags: Tag[]

### [BoxArea108 â†’ SearchInput (extracted from original lines 45 - 77)] 

1. Search icon accessibility (line 65)
   - Issue: Search icon has no aria-hidden="true" attribute, can confuse screen readers
   - Fix: Added aria-hidden="true" and proper ARIA labels for the search input
2. useEffect infinite loop potential (lines 54-56)
   - Issue: useEffect with onSearch dependency can cause infinite renders if parent doesn't memoize the callback
   - Fix: Replaced with debounced search hook that safely handles search calls without dependency issues
